   <p>Recipe creator tooth describes this dish as "Fried and battered chicken medallions glazed in a sweet pineapple sauce mixed with pineapple chunks, slices of red bell pepper, and green onions with warm Latino spices. Serve with a side of white rice."</p>
   <h4>Ingredients</h4>
   <ul>
       <li>1 ½ tablespoons soy sauce</li>
       <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
       <li>½ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
       <li>½ teaspoon garlic powder</li>
       <li>½ teaspoon ground cumin</li>
       <li>3 boneless, skinless chicken breasts, sliced into bite-sized medallions</li>
       <li>1 (20 ounce) can pineapple chunks in syrup</li>
       <li>1 ½ cups white sugar</li>
       <li>2 cups potato starch, or as needed</li>
       <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil, or more as needed</li>
       <li>1 teaspoon vegetable oil</li>
       <li>2 tablespoons tomato paste</li>
       <li>1 red bell pepper, cored and sliced</li>
       <li>3 green onions, sliced</li>
   </ul>
   <h4>Steps</h4>
   <ol>
       <li>Whisk soy sauce, salt, pepper, garlic powder, and cumin together in a large glass or ceramic bowl. Add chicken medallions and toss to evenly coat. Set aside to marinate.</li>
       <li>Combine pineapple chunks, syrup, and sugar in a medium pot over medium-high heat; bring to a boil. Boil until sugar has dissolved, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove from the stove, transfer pineapple chunks to a bowl, and leave syrup in the pot.</li>
       <li>Place potato starch in a bowl. Dredge marinated chicken medallions in potato starch; shake off excess.</li>
       <li>Heat 1 tablespoon vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add chicken, working in batches and adding more oil if necessary, and fry until golden brown and crunchy, about 3 minutes per side. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate.</li>
       <li>Heat remaining 1 teaspoon vegetable oil in a wok. Add tomato paste; cook and stir until paste darkens, being careful it does not burn. Add bell pepper and cook until slightly softened but still crispy, 1 to 2 minutes. Mix in chicken medallions and pineapple chunks. Slowly mix in some of the syrup until mixture is lightly glazed; reserve remaining syrup for another use. Sprinkle with green onions.</li>

   </ol>
